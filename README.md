4. Marketing Expenditure and Sales Amount by Month (for Sales Teams)
The graph shows marketing expenditure by Team A and Team B.

May and June: relatively low marketing expenditure with steady but moderate sales.
July saw the highest marketing expenditure and sales for both teams, indicating a strong correlation between marketing spend and sales performance.

5.Marketing Expenditure by Region:
The West region has the highest marketing expenditure, followed by the East, South, and North.

Despite the highest marketing spend in the West, it seems that the sales performance in the West doesn't correspond to the marketing investment, as it shows lower sales amounts compared to other regions.

6. Sales Amount by Month and Region
The Ribbon Chart shows:

The North and South regions contribute the most in terms of sales revenue, despite not having the highest marketing spend.
The West region, despite high marketing investment, shows lower sales compared to North and South, indicating a need to assess the effectiveness of marketing strategies in that area.

Final Insights:

West region marketing strategy might need optimization:

Despite heavy marketing investment, sales performance in the West lags behind. This indicates either a mismatch between marketing efforts and target audience or less effective strategies.

North and South regions show better marketing ROI: 

These regions are generating higher sales with less marketing expenditure, indicating a more efficient use of marketing resources.

Focus on July: 

The spike in both marketing spend and sales in July shows that the investment in marketing can pay off if strategies are well-targeted.
Re-evaluating marketing strategies in the West region could potentially increase sales, and the company might also consider boosting investment in the more responsive North and South regions for better overall performance.
